# Fortran code converter for CalculiX 2.16

Converts old CalculiX Fortran 77 code to the one with free form. Shifts comments and continuation marks for better code folding. Compiles all Fortran sources with *-ffree-form* flag. Takes files to be compiled from *Makefile.inc*. To understand the difference in sources see [screenshots](#screenshots).

The script has already converted original CalculiX sources from folder *ccx_2.16* and put them into:

- [ccx_linux/ccx_2.16_ffree_form](./ccx_linux/ccx_2.16_ffree_form)
- [ccx_windows/ccx_2.16_ffree_form](./ccx_windows/ccx_2.16_ffree_form)

Also those folders include compiled ARPACK and SPOOLES libraries.

Converted CalculiX sources are compiled with multithreading using Makefile_MT.

<br/><br/>



# Downloads

Release version of binaries, converted and compiled sources together with original code could be downloaded from [the releases page](https://github.com/imirzov/ccx_free_form_fortran/releases).

Compiled with multithreading CalculiX CrunchiX binary is here:

- [for Linux](./ccx_linux/ccx_2.16_ffree_form/ccx_2.16_MT)
- [for Windows](./ccx_windows/ccx_2.16_ffree_form/ccx_2.16_MT.exe)

Windows version may need [Cygwin dlls](cygwin_dlls.zip) to be placed in a working directory to run a calculation.

# How to use

Default usage of the converter is:

    python3 free_form_fortran.py

Also you can explicitly point existing folders to process:

    python3 free_form_fortran.py original_sources_dir converted_sources_dir
